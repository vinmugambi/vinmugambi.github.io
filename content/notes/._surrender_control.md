I'm scared about letting other people make decisions for me especially about the things I care about [^1]. I'm cautions, it's hard to tell intentions. I may confuse help for danger.

I find to easier to forgive myself for mistakes I made all by myself compared to those where I relied on someone else's advice.

  _I know someone who drives across the country on long trips, rather than flying.  Air travel scares him.  Statistics, naturally, show that flying a given distance is much safer than driving it.  But some people fear too much the loss of control that comes from not having their own hands on the steering wheel.  It's a common complaint._
  _The future sounds less scary if you imagine yourself having lots of control over it.  For every awful thing that you imagine happening to you, you can imagine, "But I won't choose that, so it will be all right."_
  _And if it's not your own hands on the steering wheel, you think of scary things, and imagine, "What if this is chosen for me, and I can't say no?"_
