title: Your ideas are worth nothing
description: until they are tested against real users

I've come across a lot conversations where people lament about stolen ideas. How they feel robbed that Safaricom didn't pay them after adding a feature/product they had suggested on twitter. I've even met hackathon participants unwilling to share ideas worried they'd be stolen.

This is how I feel about all these idea stealing talks. Until the outcomes of your ideas has been validated against targets and brought desirable outcomes, it worth exactly zero.

Probably this fear comes the idea not holding water. You don't believe in it.

And most ideas when fully fleshed out turn out be illogical. You'll come across some wrong assumption you hadn't clearly thought of. How could you be so stupid to think this would work.
