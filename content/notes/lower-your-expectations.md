Sometimes when I need something, I tend to be very specific. For things I've had before, this can be help me reach quick decisions and take action. So I stick to the products, I have always used until they fail me.

But when I don't have a clear image of what I want, or I never had the thing I want, it's risky to be specific. It almost always ends in disappointment. After wasting lots of time I'll often discover that the elaborate thing I wanted isn't available or never existed. And if it's available it's too costly. What worse, even then you can't tell if it meets your imagined specifications beforehand [^2].

For things I don't understand well, I am trying to be less elaborate. Maybe reconsider and go whats available and affordable and hope it don't fail me [^1].

  _I could have imagined an elaborate cake that calls for cake pans Sydnie doesn’t have, or cake-building and decorating techniques she’s not mastered. The result would be a cake I can’t afford, one that Sydnie couldn’t predictably deliver before my daughter’s birthday_

  _Offering people more choices that differ along many dimensions, may diminish their satisfaction with their final choice.  Losses are more painful than the corresponding gains are pleasurable, so people think of the dimensions along which their final choice was inferior, and of all the other opportunities passed up.  If you can only choose one dessert, you're likely to be happier choosing from a menu of two than from a menu of fourteen.  Refusing tempting choices consumes mental energy and decreases performance on other cognitive tasks.  A video game that contained an always-visible easier route through, would probably be less fun to play even if that easier route were deliberately foregone.  You can imagine a Devil who follows someone around, making their life miserable, solely by offering them options which are never actually taken.  And what if a worse option is taken due to a predictable mistake?  There are many ways to harm people by offering them more choices_
