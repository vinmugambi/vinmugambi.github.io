# Proxies as substitutes for outcomes
My friend has dreamed of buying an IPhone for more than two months. I asked her why she is so insistent on it. An influencer gig at friends beautique, she said, was the motivation. And she believes IPhones effortlessly capture great images for marketing. So once she buys the phone she definitely secures the gig. 

It can be argued that what she really wanted was an IPhone, she just used the gig to rationalise it. But I want to focus on the reverse where the gig was the actual goal. Because it is a good example of when we focus on a proxy when we have lost track on our goals. She could find alternatives to buying her own IPhone, like renting a good camera, and secure the gig sooner.

Proxies can drift away from your real goals and it's often hard to tell it.[^2] You stop looking at the outcomes you want instead seek to satisfy the proxies. You have to occasionally stop and investigate if the things you focus is on serve your real motives. If not, realign to match your true goals.

You'll be surprised that attaining the proxy, often doesn't achieve your goal. In our case, my friend could buy an IPhone, after saving for several months, and still fail to secure the influencer gig.

I think of those things that are in the path to you real goal, consume a a lot of resources. Such that they get you thinking I need to achieve first if I am ever to get my desired outcomes.

    _A common example is process as proxy. Good process serves you so you can serve customers. But if you’re not watchful, the process can become the thing. This can happen very easily in large organizations. The process becomes the proxy for the result you want. You stop looking at outcomes and just make sure you’re doing the process right. Gulp. It’s not that rare to hear a junior leader defend a bad outcome with something like, “Well, we followed the process.” A more experienced leader will use it as an opportunity to investigate and improve the process. The process is not the thing. It’s always worth asking, do we own the process or does the process own us? In a Day 2 company, you might find it’s the second._

    _Another example: market research and customer surveys can become proxies for customers – something that’s especially dangerous when you’re inventing and designing products. “Fifty-five percent of beta testers report being satisfied with this feature. That is up from 47% in the first survey.” That’s hard to interpret and could unintentionally mislead_
