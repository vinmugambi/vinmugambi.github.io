# Record thoughts instead of sources to create knowledge

I seldom read for fun. When I read, I intend to use that knowledge to solve immediate challenges. In the past I have spent lots of times revisiting articles/books that I already read, looking for the same information. It bothers me that other than for a few scattered facts, I struggle to remember thing I previously learnt. 

To remedy this, I have reserved original texts by saving digital books, bookmarking links to web articles, and sometimes even pasting entire articles into my note editor. I hoped to reference them in case I faced a problem that required them. I had fallen for collectors fallacy [^3]. As a result, have an ever expanding list of things I need to read.

Christian advices that one should think of knowledge as something you create as opposed to being transmitted to you. When you read the writer thinks for you [^2]. You are tempted to think that you'd wholly capture the writer's intention. But, it's only when you think the texts through, make sense of them and take notes that you create knowledge. 

Your brain automatically filters the parts that matter to you. You have to grapple with them. Ask yourself questions. What is the writers point? Where does it apply? What are the assumptions?  It's the thoughts that texts evoked in you that matter. It's these that you should keep by writing thus creating knowledge. [^1]

You'll also find that working with notes you had written yourself easier to work with in future. Because they follow your own mental process.

    _When we read, another person thinks for us: we merely repeat his mental process. … For the more one reads the fewer are the traces left of what one has read; the mind is like a tablet that has been written over and over. Hence it is impossible to reflect; and it is only by reflection that one can assimilate what one has read if one reads straight ahead without pondering over it later, what has been read does not take root, but is for the most part lost. Indeed, it is the same with mental as with bodily food: scarcely the fifth part of what a man takes is assimilated; the remainder passes off in evaporation, respiration, and the like_
[^3] Collector fallacy  
    https://zettelkasten.de/posts/collectors-fallacy/  
    _There’s a tendency in all of us to gather useful stuff and feel good about it. To collect is a reward in itself. As knowledge workers, we’re inclined to look for the next groundbreaking thought, for intellectual stimulation: we pile up promising books and articles, and we store half the internet as bookmarks, just so we get the feeling of being on the cutting edge_
    
    _Let’s call this “The Collector’s Fallacy”. Why fallacy? Because ‘to know about something’ isn’t the same as ‘knowing something’. Just knowing about a thing is less than superficial since knowing about is merely to be certain of its existence, nothing more. Ultimately, this fake-knowledge is hindering us on our road to true excellence. Until we merge the contents, the information, ideas, and thoughts of other people into our own knowledge, we haven’t really learned a thing. We don’t change ourselves if we don’t learn, so merely filing things away doesn’t lead us anywhere_
