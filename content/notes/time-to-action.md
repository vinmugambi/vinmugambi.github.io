# Time to action

I have had noble ideas that could change my life. Almost always I have hesitated to take action on them and end up forgetting them all together. Like fo example, I have contemplated writing a blog for several years. And when I actually made a move, it's some external force that made me do it.

I think these are the things that led me to delay action in the past:

- Don't have the tools
- Don't know where to start
- Not confident it will work. The more remote the rewards, the larger the risk that they will for some reason never materialize. See [Willpower - Evidence produces action](/willpower-as-a-function-of-evidence)
- Fear of embarrassment or failure. See dogma [Learner not a teacher](/learner-not-a-teacher)
- Things I think have to de achieved prior. See [Proxies for goals](/proxies-for-goals)
- Don't feel confident of my ability to do it.

I have been trying to build a systems that brings ideas to timely closure. [^1]

    _Tasks left undone, observations left unrecorded, replies yet to be written—these swirl about our minds, as if we’re rehearsing them over and over again to make sure they’re not forgotten. To get rid of this nagging and create a “mind like water”, build systems to reliably close these open loops_
