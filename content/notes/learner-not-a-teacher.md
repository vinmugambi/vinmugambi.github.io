# Learner not a teacher

I spent a good portion the last few weeks studying lean methodologies. I felt driven to account for this stretch of time by producing a minimal blog about user stories. But every time sat to write, I hesitated worried I couldn't efficiently explain the topic in a manner that the reader will act on it in a single article.

When submitting work, I fear looking like a charlatan. I try to make it perfect. And this keeps keeps me away from doing a lot of things.

Christian overcame a similar problem [^1], when about to publish his first book, by viewing himself as a learner, not a teacher. The work he produces doesn't have to be complete but commits to update with any information he acquires as he continues learning. 

He quit viewing his book as an explicit manual but an exchange of what he learned.  He is not afraid to make mistakes as he can always make revisions. Perfection, was no longer his goal.  This way he publishes confidently and continuously.  

He advises that one finds dogma aligned with his true self and aim to realize it. When confronted with tough situations in life, a move anchored to ones true dogmas will be more satisfying.

  _At the same evening of this event, my old project on writing sneaked into my mind. I realized that I couldn’t finish it because it had no connection to my dogmas. I never pictured me as a teacher. I am a learner who likes to exchange with other learners. This piece of writing was the sum of what I learned._  
  _I didn’t write a manual to my method. I wrote a piece on writing from the perspective of a budding writer. I offer my perspective on methods on writing only._
