# Introductions - why

I struggle to think of interesting ways to introduce a thought piece. I don't want to bore the reader right away with intros that smell incompetence. In this note introductions that stroke my eyes.

- I have noticed a troubling trend in Agile development over the past few years - that's the decrease in recommended size of a user story. It's not the decrease in story size that is concerning but the lack of practices and techniques to support this approach :: Here Jeff Patton describes how the push to reduce story sizes pushes a team further from user goals and forces more upfront design into Agile processes. An effective way to introduce  a rant.

- If you have heard about the term dual track development before and you wonder what it means. Here are the key points :: A simple and effective way to introduce a topic might know about but don't don't understand.

- "Clean code that works", in Ron Jeffries' pithy phrase, is the goal of Test Driven Development. Clean code that works is a worthwhile goal for a bunch of reasons :: Kent beck preface to the TDD book. He then lists reasons. Start with a phrase and describe what it means. This is a strong introduction technique that tells the reader why reading your text matters.
