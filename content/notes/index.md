# Notes
I write these notes while learning in order to cement knowledge. Beside crafting software products, I spend most of my time learning. I value being good at things and believe learning is how i get there. In fact, I consider learning itself one of my core foundations and aim to become better at it.

In the past few years, I have gradually realized that I lost a lot of the knowledge I acquired. It appears that I discarded knowledge as soon I was past the problem I was solving.  And when faced with a similar problem later I had to learn all over again. When I landed on Andy Matuschack notes by accident in 2021, I began to contemplate writing to think clearly and grasp what I learn for longer.

Being good at things matters to me. So it's important that I accumulate insights into things I care about. This is the main reason I write these notes. See [Write about what you read](/write-about-what-you-read)

Other times I write as I reflect on past moments where my approaches have been inefficient in attempt to see things differently and develop better techniques.

I like to think for myself instead of going by what's popular, what I'm told or what I read. I'm thus keen to deeply understand the world, myself, my goals, my challenges to distil what's valuable to me from what is not and to forge my way through the complex world. 

As a software developer, I spend a huge part of my days learning and trying things out when creating potentially useful products. There so much to discover. The web sends lots of materials to me and It's important that I identify and distil what's valuable from what is not, and retain it for a long time. To effectively do this, I needed to map the world, my goals, and my challenges.

A large part of building software products is continuously learning ways to effectively solve problems

Write to account for time spent reading - Measure progress.

I hope to someday compile useful things from these notes.
