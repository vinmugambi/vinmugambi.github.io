## Why

I started rolling on inline skates 6 months ago. Skating quickly turns boring when you do it alone. Older skaters reach a plateau after some time, when they lack time and skating buddies. Soon after, they begin to consider hanging the boots. I have heard from three friends who had similar problems.

Finding people to skate along is challenging. We routinely visit a skating rink and hope to find your kind of skaters in the park. Sometimes I go there and immediately consider going back home.  disappointed: Thi is when the skaters I find there are either too young, too skilled, too unskilled. However, sometimes it's what I'd hope for and I have lots of :satisfied: fun. I still have to worry :worried: the latter before heading to a rink.

I also don't know a lot of rinks. I could be travelling 10 kilometres when there's a rink a stone throw from my house. Google isn't very helpful on this. The rinks I know were shown to me by a friend.

Your friends could be in another rink unknown to you. And it matters who you roll with.

Knowing many rinks isn't good either. You first have weigh the options :confused: to decide where you are likely have the most fun.

Before starting skating, I wanted to a new hobby, didn't know which or how I would start. It was not until, I accompanied my brother to a skating rink, that I decided to try.

I was a lonesome runner aiming to lose belly fat between 2020 and 2021. Even that took a lot of courage :worried: to start.

Before that, I had joined a jim in the estate where I :weary: struggled with attendance.
